    <h1>Ten things we know to be true</h1>
    <p>One of the earliest culture setting activities we did at CFS was writing a list of "ten things we know to be
        true". This activity was likely suggested by one of our advisors who was an early engineering leader at Google.
        Google had first written down its <a href="https://about.google/company-info/philosophy/">ten truths</a> around
        2004 and published them online for the world to see. The ten truths are used to capture a company's core beliefs
        in simple statements.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits of truths</h2>
    <p>I found that writing these truths was a more powerful and useful activity than a standard set of
        company values. The problem with listing company values is they are all too often generic and
        non-differentiating (e.g., very few companies would not say they do not value integrety or respect). Writing the
        things you know
        to be true goes much deeper. It is an exercise in world building and culture creation. It is the logical next
        step after writing out your <a href="https://futuretech.partners/lessons-audacious-goals.htm">audacious
            goals</a>, which describe what your company is going to accomplish. Your truths lay out the frameworks and
        methedology by which your company works to achieve its audacious goals.</p>
    <p>A well-formulated set of truths facilitates:
    <ul>
        <li><em>North-star:</em> Each point is memorable and unambiguous, so employees know what “good” looks
            like without endless policy docs. Write them while the team is small to guide future decisions at
            scale.</li>
        <li><em>Decision heuristic:</em> Teams can use the truths to make cruicial decisions when there is not an
            otherwise clear path forward.</li>
        <li><em>Cultural consistency:</em> As the organization grows, passing on the early culture becomes challenging.
            The truths serve as an educational document to ensure that the culture is passed on.</li>
        <li><em>External brand:</em> Publishing the truths signals transparency and invites outsiders to hold
            your company accountable to them.</li>
        <li><em>Recruiting and retention:</em> Making your truths available to candidates helps self-select for those
            who are culturally aligned.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis of truths</h2>
    <p>CFS' ten truths have not yet been published publicly, so I cannot examine it in detail here (I will if it ever is
        made public). But, the major themes shouldn't surprise you: recognizing the power of the scientific method,
        applying innovation where it has the highest leverage, predicting that human creativity and inexepnsive energy
        will drive the future, etc. Instead, I will examine <a
            href="https://about.google/company-info/philosophy/">Google's ten truths</a> as an exercise to help you
        build yours (see the link for Google's explanations of each truth).</p>
    <h3>1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.</h3>
    <p>This is a great anchor truth to start Google's list. It provides a clear guideline to decision-making: Does the
        outcome of the decision put the user first? If so, then the decision reinforces more user engagement and
        therefore
        benefits the company.</p>
    <h3>2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</h3>
    <p>Google's second truth establishes their monomaniacal focus, a focus that is critical for early-stage startups
        need to succeed. This was a great guiding truth at the begining, when Google focused predominantly on internet
        search. Now, in my opinion, they have not strictly stuck to this truth. While the focus on search has expanded
        to organizing all information, the company has such an impressive breadth in what they offer, it is a stretch to
        say that they focus on doing only one thing really well. Nonetheless, this evolution shows that it is okay for
        your truths to evolve over time, as there is a risk of being disrupted if you stay static.</p>
    <h3>3. Fast is better than slow.</h3>
    <p>The third truth is a derivative of the first: delivering what the user wants. A slow product is frustrating and
        would drive away their user base. This truth is counter to the philosophy of the search industry in the
        early 2000's, which was to try to capture the user's attention for as long as possible. Instead, users of Google
        got thier results quickly and then came back for more. This is a great example of Peter Theil's signature
        question: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"</p>
    <h3>4. Democracy on the web works.</h3>
    <p>The fourth truth gets at the heart of what makes Google's technology, the PageRank algorithm, work. It was their
        unique insight that the "voting" of the links between websites was a superior way of identifying quality search
        results. This is the core conviction behind the differentiation of their principle product. It will be
        interesting to watch how this evolves in our present age of AI.</p>
    <h3>5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.</h3>
    <p>The fifth truth was very forward looking. These truths were first penned years before the iPhone, when cell
        phones were relatively simple devices. This truth is a prime example of a founding team's vision of a bold,
        new future enabled by the company's product. It is impressive that they already had the foresight of the
        importance of mobile computing and nearly limitless access to information.</p>
    <h3>6. You can make money without doing evil.</h3>
    <p>The sixth truth is, like the third, a reaction against outside industry trends. The explanation Google has
        published about this truth focuses on how Google deploys ads in its products, its primary source of revenue. The
        advertisement industry is often portratyed in a negative context becuase of its goal to convince a consumer to
        buy a product that is potentially not needed. Google set out this truth to establish how it ethically earns
        money through ads. Having an ethical framework is an important part of just about any professional field (e.g.,
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#Text_of_the_oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> in medicine
        or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Engineer#Oath">Obligation of an Engineer</a>).
    </p>
    <p>This truth also provides an important lesson: Google should be lauded for making their truths public.
        Public truths drive accountability. If you claim to hold yourself to an ethical standard and appear to fall
        short, people will speak up about it.</p>
    <h3>7. There’s always more information out there.</h3>
    <p>The seventh truth is another forward-looking innovation truth. It recognizes that while Google's first major
        innovation and product was search on internet webpages, its business and technology extended far beyond. Google
        was not just an internet search engine, its core skill and product for consumers was the aggregation of
        information and returning the best results for the user based on the user's query.</p>
    <h3>8. The need for information crosses all borders.</h3>
    <p>The eighth truth sets the expanse of who the company serves. Google recognized the relative borderlessness of the
        internet both geographically and linguistically, the utility of its tools, and the need for information to cross
        previously impervious barriers.</p>
    <h3>9. You can be serious without a suit.</h3>
    <p>The ninth truth is a core expression of Google's way of working. While embedded in the broader Silicon
        Valley culture, this truth was nonetheless important to make explicit. This is a pragmatic expression of their
        vision of a work environment in which achievement takes priority over appearance and is therefore most conducive
        to getting a productive workforce.</p>
    <h3>10. Great just isn’t good enough.</h3>
    <p>The final truth is a rallying call for continual improvement. In it Google communicates to its team members to
        always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve, setting an important tone for the culture of how they
        work. This truth also communicates to Google's users that the company will always be working to deliver a
        superior product. By adhering to this truth, Google outpaced its competition and kept its users engaged rather
        than letting users wander astray to other search engines.</p>
    <h2>Tips for writing truths</h2>
    <p>Writing your truths should be an enjoyable process. It is codifying into plain-speech the core of what makes your
        company unique and what will enable it to succeed. Do not feel beholden to come up with exactly 10 truths, 8 or
        12 truths are just as good, but try to not expand it much more. Here's how to get started.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Gather founder truths:</em> Have founders independently write down truths that feel
            non-negotiable. Come together and discuss them. Find common ground. Look for surprises. Iterate with
            each other. Downselect to a core subset.</li>
        <li><em>Stress-test with real decisions:</em> For each truth, ask “Would this have changed a tough call we
            made recently?” If it would not, the truth is probably too generic. Think of future important decisions and
            consider the truths against them. How well do the truths serve you in answering the decisions?</li>
        <li><em>Write in plain speech:</em> Use common words and everyday language. Avoid buzzwords and jargon. Long
            sentences lose punch. Keep each truth short and memorable.</li>
        <li><em>Consider publishing publicly:</em> Sharing your truths publicly invites critical feedback. It
            provides an avenue for public accountability and serves as a recruitment beacon for those that will
            fit in with your culture.</li>
        <li><em>Incorperate everywhere:</em> To be an effective conveyance of the company culture, the truths must be
            used. It is the role of leadership to ensure adoption and use. Share the truths throughout the company.
            Introduce the truths as part of onboarding. Refer to the truths during all-hands meetings and 
            leadership team meetings. Use the truths as a backdrop for individual goal setting. Make the truths a
            natural part of working at your company.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions to derive truths</h3>
    <p>From Google's ten truths, I have come up with a series of questions to help you derive your own truths for your
        company. Feel free to expand beyond this list with your own thruth-deriving questions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Anchor:</em> What is the most important hueristic that you can come up with to clearly drive your
            company's decisions?</li>
        <li><em>Focus:</em> What truth guides what you will focus on?</li>
        <li><em>Unorthodox:</em> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?</li>
        <li><em>Innovation:</em> What is the simple truth behind your innovation?</li>
        <li><em>Forecasting:</em> What does a future look like with your technology? What does your technology
            enable? How does your technology change with other innovations?</li>
        <li><em>Ethics:</em> What is an important ethical truth you should hold yourself accountable to?</li>
        <li><em>Evolution:</em> Looking beyond what you are doing today, what is the core truth at the center of
            what you are delivering that will continue into the future?</li>
        <li><em>Breadth:</em> What is the ultimate potential expanse of your technology's impact?</li>
        <li><em>Productivity:</em> What workplace culture do you envision is most conducive to your team working
            together and producing your product effectively?</li>
        <li><em>Behavior:</em> What truths help keep your team and/or your customers engaged in the right
            behavior(s)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your truths are written well, they should require minimal changes over time. But it is a good exercise
        to periodically revisit your truths and check to see if they are still serving you as the world changes.</p>
    <p>I hope you have a fun time forming your company's truths. If you need help in this exercise, do reach out, I
        would be glad to facilitate your truth creation.</p>
