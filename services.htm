      <h1>Services</h1>

      <p>
        We work with fusion companies, investors, suppliers, utilities, hyperscalers, and industrial offtakers who are deciding when and how to participate in fusion, while continuing to support select non-fusion deep-tech startups and investors where our experience is relevant.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of our fusion services, we publish <a href="https://www.fusionconclusion.com">The Fusion Conclusion</a>: a free weekly newsletter for the "fusion curious", which features essays on the state and trajectory of the fusion industry, technical deep dives, and fortnightly industry updates.
      </p>

      <h3>Fusion Strategy &amp; Industry Forecasting</h3>

      <p>
        For companies and institutions that need a clear view of where fusion is actually going and what it means for them.
      </p>

      <p>We help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand realistic fusion timelines and technology scenarios;</li>
        <li>map how fusion could affect your business model, assets, and competitive position;</li>
        <li>identify when to move (and when to wait) on partnerships, PPAs, pilots, or investments; and</li>
        <li>communicate fusion opportunities and risks in plain language for boards and decision makers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Typical clients: Utilities, hyperscalers and data center operators, industrial heat users, OEMs/suppliers, corporate strategy teams.
      </p>

      <h3>Fusion Technical &amp; Commercial Due Diligence</h3>

      <p>
        For investors and strategic buyers evaluating fusion and fusion-adjacent companies.
      </p>

      <p>We provide science-first diligence with a focus on commercial reality, assessing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>technical feasibility from first principles (plasma physics, magnets, power systems, cryogenics);</li>
        <li>strengths and weaknesses of the IP and know-how;</li>
        <li>capital intensity, pathway to commercialization, and key execution risks; and</li>
        <li>founding and technical team ability to deliver against milestones.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We also perform deep-tech diligence outside of fusion (advanced materials, lasers, isotopes, industrial processes, etc.) where our background is relevant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typical clients: VC and growth funds, infrastructure and sovereign investors, corporate venture arms, family offices.
      </p>

      <h3>Fusion Policy &amp; Government Interface</h3>

      <p>
        For industry and government leaders seeking to turn fusion enthusiasm into concrete programs and outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>We translate between the languages of science, business, and policy to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>connect national objectives with realistic fusion technology roadmaps;</li>
        <li>structure effective public-private partnerships and funding mechanisms;</li>
        <li>review and stress-test fusion-related policy proposals; and</li>
        <li>help companies position themselves for government partnerships, grants, and loan programs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Typical clients: Government agencies, national labs, economic development groups, fusion companies engaging with public programs.
      </p>

      <h3>Startup advisor &amp; Fractional CTO</h3>

      <p>
        For inventors, scientists, and engineers ready to commercialize fusion or other game-changing technologies.
      </p>

      <p>We offer startup technical leadership and direction in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>technology and product roadmapping;</li>
        <li>risk identification and mitigation;</li>
        <li>intellectual property strategy;</li>
        <li>systems engineering and management setup; and</li>
        <li>team building, organizational design, and technical hiring.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Typical clients: Early-stage fusion and deep-tech startups, especially where the founding team wants an experienced technical co-pilot
        without adding a full-time executive.
      </p>

      <hr><h3>Expert Witness & Litigation Support</h3>

      <p>
        For legal counsel litigating complex IP and liability cases in fusion energy, superconductors, and advanced hardware.
      </p>

      <p>We leverage deep experimental authority, backed by an MIT PhD and a portfolio of patents in High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnets, to support your case strategy by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>conducting first-principles forensic reconstruction and root cause failure analysis;</li>
        <li>experimentally validating theoretical models to differentiate between "possible" and "proven";</li>
        <li>dissecting patent claims versus prior art in advanced technologies, with a focus on fusion and superconducting magnets; and</li>
        <li>translating dense physical phenomena into clear, compelling narratives for judges and juries.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We also perform deep-tech diligence outside of fusion (advanced materials, lasers, isotopes, industrial processes, etc.)
        where our background is relevant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typical clients: VC and growth funds, infrastructure and sovereign investors, corporate venture arms, family offices.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re unsure which of these fits your situation, reach out and we can decide together whether and how we can help
        in fusion or beyond.
