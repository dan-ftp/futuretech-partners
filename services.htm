<h2>Services</h2>

<p>
  Future Tech Partners is a boutique advisory focused on fusion energy and the enabling technologies around it (HTS magnets, cryogenics, lasers, advanced materials, power systems).
</p>

<p>
  We work with fusion companies, investors, suppliers, utilities, hyperscalers, and industrial offtakers who are deciding when and how to participate in fusion, while continuing to support select non-fusion deep-tech startups and investors where our experience is relevant.
</p>
    
<p>
  As part of our fusion services, we publish <a href="https://www.fusionconclusion.com">The Fusion Conclusion</a>: a free weekly newsletter for the "fusion curious", which features essays on the state and trajectory of the fusion industry, technical deep dives, and fortnightly industry updates.

<h3>Fusion Strategy &amp; Industry Forecasting</h3>

<p>
  For companies and institutions that need a clear view of where fusion is actually going and what it means for them.
</p>

<p>We help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>understand realistic fusion timelines and technology scenarios;</li>
  <li>map how fusion could affect your business model, assets, and competitive position;</li>
  <li>identify when to move (and when to wait) on partnerships, PPAs, pilots, or investments; and</li>
  <li>communicate fusion opportunities and risks in plain language for boards and decision makers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Typical clients: Utilities, hyperscalers and data center operators, industrial heat users, OEMs/suppliers, corporate strategy teams.
</p>

<h3>Fusion Technical &amp; Commercial Due Diligence</h3>

<p>
  For investors and strategic buyers evaluating fusion and fusion-adjacent companies.
</p>

<p>We provide science-first diligence with a focus on commercial reality, assessing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>technical feasibility from first principles (plasma physics, magnets, power systems, cryogenics);</li>
  <li>strengths and weaknesses of the IP and know-how;</li>
  <li>capital intensity, pathway to commercialization, and key execution risks; and</li>
  <li>founding and technical team ability to deliver against milestones.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We also perform deep-tech diligence outside of fusion (advanced materials, lasers, isotopes, industrial processes)
  where our background is relevant.
</p>

<p>
  Typical clients: VC and growth funds, infrastructure and sovereign investors, corporate venture arms, family offices.
</p>

<h3>Fusion Policy &amp; Government Interface</h3>

<p>
  For industry and government leaders seeking to turn fusion enthusiasm into concrete programs and outcomes.
</p>

<p>We translate between the languages of science, business, and policy to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>connect national objectives with realistic fusion technology roadmaps;</li>
  <li>structure effective public-private partnerships and funding mechanisms;</li>
  <li>review and stress-test fusion-related policy proposals; and</li>
  <li>help companies position themselves for government partnerships, grants, and loan programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Typical clients: Government agencies, national labs, economic development groups, fusion companies engaging with public programs.
</p>

<h3>Fractional CTO &amp; Venture Partner</h3>

<p>
  For inventors, scientists, and engineers ready to commercialize fusion or other game-changing technologies.
</p>

<p>We offer startup technical leadership and direction in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>technology and product roadmapping;</li>
  <li>risk identification and mitigation;</li>
  <li>intellectual property strategy;</li>
  <li>systems engineering and management setup; and</li>
  <li>team building, organizational design, and technical hiring.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Typical clients: Early-stage fusion and deep-tech startups, especially where the founding team wants an experienced technical co-pilot
  without adding a full-time executive.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  If you’re unsure which of these fits your situation, reach out and we can decide together whether and how we can help
  in fusion or beyond.
