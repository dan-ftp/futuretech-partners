    <h1>Helping you turn science fiction into reality.</h1>

    <p>
      Future Tech Partners is a boutique advisory for fusion energy and other
      frontier technologies where the physics, engineering, and industrialization
      challenges are real. We bring together deep technical experience,
      commercialization scars, and investor perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work with companies, investors, suppliers, utilities, hyperscalers,
      industrial offtakers, and public-sector leaders who need clear thinking
      about what is possible, on what timeline, and with what risks.
