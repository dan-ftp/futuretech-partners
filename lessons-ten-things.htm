    <h1>Ten things we know to be true</h1>
    <p>One of the earliest culture setting activities we did at CFS was writing a list of "ten things we know to be
        true". This activity was likely suggested by one of our advisors who was an early engineering leader at Google.
        Google had first written down its <a href="https://about.google/company-info/philosophy/">ten truths</a> around
        2004 and published them online for the world to see. The ten truths are used to capture a company's core beliefs
        in simple statements.
    </p>
    <h2>Benifits of truths</h2>
    <p>I found that writing out these ten things to be a more powerful and useful activity than a standard set of
        company values, as is often done. The problem with listing company values is they are all too often generic and
        non-differentiating (e.g., very few companies would not have integrety or respect). Writing the things you know
        to be true goes much deeper. It is an exercise in world building and culture creation. It is the logical next
        step after writing out your <a href="https://futuretech.partners/lessons-audacious-goals.htm">audacious
            goals</a>, which describe what your company is going to accomplish. Your truths lay out the frameworks and
        methedology by which your company works to achieve its audacious goals.</p>
    <p>A well-formulated set of truths facilitates:
    <ul>
        <li><em>North-star:</em> Each point is memorable and unambiguous, so employees know what “good” looks
            like without endless policy docs. Write them while when the team was small to guide future decisions at
            scale.</li>
        <li><em>Decision heuristic:</em> Teams can use the truths when making cruicial decisions when there is not an
            otherwise clear path forward.</li>
        <li><em>Cultural consistency:</em> As the organization grows passing on the early culture becomes challenging,
            the truths serve as an educational document to pass on the culture.</li>
        <li><em>External brand:</em> Publishing the truths signals transparency and invites outsiders to hold
            your company accountable to them.</li>
        <li><em>Recruiting and retention:</em> Making your truths available to candidates helps self-select for those
            who are culturally aligned.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis of truths</h2>
    <p>CFS' ten things has not yet been published publicly, so I cannot examine it in detail here (I will if it ever is
        made public). But, the major themes shouldn't surprise you: recognizing the power of the scientific method,
        applying innovation where it has the highest leverage, predicting that human creativity and inexepnsive energy
        will drive the future, etc. Instead, I will examine <a
            href="https://about.google/company-info/philosophy/">Google's ten things</a> as an exercise to help you
        build yours (see the link for Google's explinaions of each truth).</p>
    <h3>1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.</h3>
    <p>This is a great anchor truth to start Google's list. It provides a clear focus when making decisions: does it
        focus on the user? If so, then it reinforces more user engagement</p>
    <h3>2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</h3>
    <p>Google's second truth sets the tone on the breadth of what they work on. While this was a great guiding truth at
        the begining, in my opinion they have not stuck to this one. The company has such an impressive breadth in what
        they offer, it is a streatch to say that they focus on doing only one thing really well. Nonetheless, this
        evolution shows that it is okay for your truths to evolve over time, as there is a risk of being disruptive if
        you stay static.</p>
    <h3>3. Fast is better than slow.</h3>
    <p>The third truth is a derivative of the first: delivering what the user wants. A slow product is frustrating to
        use and would drive away their user base. This truth is counter to the philosophy of the search industry in the
        early 2000's, which was to try to capture the user's attention as long as possible. This is a great example of
        Peter Theil's signature question "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"</p>
    <h3>4. Democracy on the web works.</h3>
    <p>The fourth truth gets at the heart of what makes Google's technology, the PageRank™ algorithm, work. It was their
        unique insight that the "voting" of the links between websites was a superior way of identifying quality search
        results.</p>
    <h3>5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.</h3>
    <p>The fifth truth was very forward looking. These truths were first penned years before the iPhone, when most of us
        who had cellphones had very simple phones. It is impressive that they already had the foresight of the
        importance of mobile computing and access to information.</p>
    <h3>6. You can make money without doing evil.</h3>
    <p>The sixth truth is, like the third, a reaction against outside industry trends. The exposition focuses on how
        Google deploys ads in its products, its primary source of revenue. As the advertisement industry, through its
        goal of getting a consumer to buy a prodcut that it potentially does not need, is often portratyed in a negative
        context. Google set out this truth to lay out how it earns money through ads while doing it ethically. Having an
        ethical framework is an important part of just about any professional field (e.g., the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#Text_of_the_oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> in medicine or
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Engineer#Oath">Obligation of an Engineer</a>).
    </p>
    <p>This truth also provides an important cautionary tale: Google should be lauded for making their truths public.
        Public truths drive accountability. If you claim to hold yourself to an ethical standard and appear to fall
        short, people will speak up about it.</p>
    <h3>7. There’s always more information out there.</h3>
    <p>The seventh truth is another forward-looking innovation truth. It recognizes that while Google's first major
        innovation and product was search on internet webpages, its business and technology extended far beyond. Google
        was not just an internet search engine, its core skill and product for consumers was the aggrigation of
        information and returning the best results for the user based on their query.</p>
    <h3>8. The need for information crosses all borders.</h3>
    <p>The eigth truth sets the expanse of who the company serves. Google recognized the relative boarderlessness of the
        internet, the utility of its tools, and the need for information accross previously hard to cross barriers.</p>
    <h3>9. You can be serious without a suit.</h3>
    <p>The ninth truth is a core expression of Google's way of working. While classic Silicon Valley startup in many
        ways, it was nonetheless important to make explicit. This is a pragmatic expression of their vision of a work
        environment that was most conducive to getting a productive workforce. For your truths, what workplace culture
        do you envision is most conducive to your team working together and producing your product effectively?</p>
    <h3>10. Great just isn’t good enough.</h3>
    <p>The final truth is a rallying call for continual improvement. In it Google communicates to its team members to
        always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve, setting an important tone for the culture of how they
        work. It also communicates to its users that it will always be working to be better than the competition,
        keeping them engaged rather than going astray.</p>
    <h2>Tips for writing truths</h2>
    <p>Writing your truths should be an enjoyable process. It is codifying into plain-speach the core of what makes your
        company unique and what will enable it to succeed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em></em>Gather founder truths:</em> Have founders independently write down truths that feel
            non-negotiable. Come together and discuss them. Find common ground. Look for surprises. Iterate with
            eachother. Downselect to a core subset.</li>
        <li><em></em>Stress-test with real decisions:</em> For each truth, ask “Would this have changed a tough call we
            made last month?” If it would not, the truth is too generic. Think of future important decisions and
            consider the truths against them. How well do they serve you in answering them?</li>
        <li><em></em>Write in plain speech:</em> Use verbs and everyday language. Avoid buzzwords and jargon. Long
            sentences lose punch, keep each truth short and memorable.</li>
        <li><em></em>Consider publishing publicly:</em> Sharing your truths publicly invites critical feedback. It
            provides an avenue for public accountability as well as serves as a recruitment beacon for those that will
            fit in with your culture.</li>
        <li><em>Incorperate everywhere:</em> To be an effective conveyance of the company culture, it must be used. And
            it is the role of leadership to ensure its use. Share it publicly. Make it part of onboarding. Refer to it
            during all-hands meetings. Use it as a backdrop for individual goal setting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions to derive truths</h3>
    <p>From Google's ten truths, I have come up with a series of questions to help you derive your own truths for your
        company. Feel free to expand beyond this list with your own thruth-deriving questions. Do not feel beholden to
        come up with exactly 10 truths, 8 or 12 truths are just as good but try to not expand it much more. Forming your
        truths should be a collaborative exercise with founders, early teammates, advisors, and anyone else in
        your closest circles that syncs with the technical and cultural vision for your company.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Anchor truth:</em> What is the most important hueristic that you can come up with to clearly drive your
            company's decisions?</li>
        <li><em>Focus truth:</em>What truth guides what you will focus on?</li>
        <li><em>Unorthodox truth:</em>What important truth do very few people agree with you on?</li>
        <li><em>Innovation truth:</em>What is the simple truth behind your innovation?</li>
        <li><em>Forecasting truth:</em>What does a future look like with your technology? What does your technology
            enable? How does your
            technology change with other innovations?</li>
        <li><em>Ethics truth:</em>What is an important ethical truth you should hold yourself to</li>
        <li><em>Evolution truth:</em>Looking beyond what you are doing today, what is the core truth at the center of
            what you are doing and delivering?</li>
        <li><em>Breadth truth:</em>What is the ultimate potential expanse of its impact?</li>
        <li><em>Behavior truth:</em>What truths help keep both your team as well as your customers
            engaged in the right behavior?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your truths are written well, they should require minimal changes over time. But it is still a good exercise
        to
        periodically revisit your truths and check to see if they are still serving you as the world changes.</p>
    <p>I hope you have a fun time forming your company's truths. If you need help in this exercise, do reach out, I
        would be glad to facilitate your truth creation.</p>
