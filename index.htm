        <h1>Helping you turn science fiction into reality.</h1>

        <p>
          Future Tech Partners is not your typical consultancy. We're scientists
          and technologists turned entrepreneurs — with the scars and wins to
          prove it. Our team has built multi-billion-dollar companies,
          developed first-of-a-kind technologies, and advised investors,
          government, and industry.
        </p>

        <p>We help:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>scientists move their technology out of the lab;</li>
          <li>investors assess and de-risk breakthrough tech;</li>
          <li>companies prepare for disruption and seize new opportunities;</li>
          <li>technologists and policy makers collaborate effectively; and</li>
          <li>individuals plan their careers in early stage technologies.</li>
        </ul>
