  <h2>Startup Lessons</h2>
  <p>I'm slowly working on compiling and writing lessons I learned while forming and building Commonwealth Fusion
    Systems. Glad get feedback on what's working and what you want to learn about. Here's what I've written so far:</p>
  <p><a href="lessons-audacious-goals.htm">Audacious goals</a>: how to write a concise set of goals to focus the
    evolution of your audacious startup.</p>
  <p><a href="lessons-truths.htm">Things we know to be true</a>: a natural follow-on after writing your audacious goals,
    crafting and living by your company truths is a much more powerful exercise setting simple company values.</p>
  <p><a href="lessons-born-at-scale.htm">Born at scale</a>: how CFS was born out of a lab funding crisis with
    lessons on navigating your own funding crisis to make something better.</p>
